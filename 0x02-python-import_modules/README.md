In Python, importing modules allows you to access pre-written code and functionalities, enhancing the capabilities of your programs. Modules are files containing Python definitions and statements. You can import a module into your script using the `import` keyword followed by the module name. For instance, to utilize functions from the `math` module, you can write `import math`. Once imported, you can access functions, variables, or classes defined in the module using the dot notation, like `math.sqrt()` to calculate the square root of a number. Python's extensive standard library provides a wide range of modules for various purposes, from mathematics (`math`) and file manipulation (`os`) to data manipulation (`pandas`) and web development (`requests`). Additionally, you can create your own modules by organizing related functions and classes into separate files, allowing for better code organization and reusability across different projects. Overall, importing modules is a powerful feature in Python that promotes code modularity, readability, and simplifies complex programming tasks by leveraging existing libraries and functionalities.
